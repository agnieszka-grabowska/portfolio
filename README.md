# My Developer Portfolio

Hi! 👋 I'm a self-taught front-end developer, and this site is my personal portfolio — a space where I share the projects I’ve worked on and a bit about me.

It’s built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, and while it’s still a work in progress, it reflects where I am right now in my journey and the kind of developer I’m growing into.

## ✨ What You'll Find

- A selection of my projects with short write-ups, tech stacks, and links to live demos and GitHub
- A design I created myself in Figma and then turned into code
- Simple UI, a few animations, and experiments with layout and styling

## 🛠 Technologies

- **Next.js** & **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **CSS Modules**
- **Vercel** (for hosting)

## 🌐 Live Demo
